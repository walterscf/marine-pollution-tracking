## Introduction

The Marine Pollution Tracking System is an advanced real-time environmental intelligence platform designed to transform how we monitor and respond to water pollution events. By integrating data from diverse sources—including IoT sensor buoys and satellite imagery—the system enables comprehensive tracking, analysis, and prediction of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.

### The Environmental Challenge

Current water pollution monitoring approaches face critical limitations that hamper effective environmental protection:

- **Data Silos**: Environmental data from different sources (sensors, satellites, manual sampling) remains disconnected, preventing comprehensive analysis
- **Delayed Response**: Manual analysis creates significant lag time between pollution events and intervention, allowing contamination to spread
- **Limited Predictive Capabilities**: Without integrated data and advanced modeling, agencies cannot anticipate pollution spread patterns
- **Reactive Paradigm**: Traditional monitoring is primarily reactive, detecting pollution only after it becomes severe

Our system addresses these challenges by creating a unified, real-time monitoring infrastructure that enables environmental agencies to identify emerging threats quickly, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted intervention strategies before pollution events become severe.

### Project Objectives

The Marine Pollution Tracking System aims to:

1. Integrate disparate data sources into a unified environmental monitoring platform
2. Enable real-time detection of pollution events as they emerge
3. Provide predictive capabilities to forecast contamination spread
4. Support data-driven decision-making for environmental protection agencies
5. Transform environmental monitoring from reactive to proactive

## System Architecture

The system implements a modern microservices architecture optimized for real-time environmental data processing. The architecture consists of several integrated layers, each handling specific aspects of the pollution monitoring workflow:

![System Architecture Diagram](./data/system_architecture_diagram.png)

### Architectural Overview

The system follows a distributed microservices pattern with event-driven communication, organized into five primary layers:

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**: Collects data from sensors and satellites, standardizing inputs before publishing to the message broker
2. **Stream Processing Layer**: Processes events in real-time using Apache Flink, performing analysis and detection
3. **Storage Layer**: Implements a medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) across multiple specialized databases
4. **Analytics Layer**: Combines rule-based detection with ML models to identify hotspots and predict spread
5. **Presentation Layer**: Provides dashboards and alerts for environmental monitoring and decision support

### Component Interaction Flow

The detailed component interaction diagram shows how data flows through the system:

![System Architecture Flow](./data/system_architecture_flow.png)

### Data Flow

1. Data sources (NOAA/USGS & SentinelHub) provide raw data to producers every 30 seconds (buoys) and 15 minutes (satellite imagery)
2. Producers publish standardized data to Kafka topics (buoy_data, satellite_imagery)
3. Flink jobs process these streams for analysis (sensor_analyzer, image_standardizer) 
4. Detection algorithms identify pollution hotspots (pollution_detector)
5. Prediction models forecast pollution spread (ml_prediction)
6. Results are stored in appropriate databases based on data type and purpose
7. The dashboard provides real-time visualization of all system insights

The architecture enables several key capabilities:

- **Decoupled Components**: Services can be developed, scaled, and maintained independently
- **Failure Isolation**: Issues in one component don't cascade throughout the system
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Components can scale based on processing demands
- **Progressive Enhancement**: The system can evolve through component upgrades

## Core Components

## Data Processing Pipeline

The system implements a sophisticated data pipeline that processes environmental information through multiple stages, ensuring reliability, accuracy, and analytical depth.

### Data Acquisition

The system ingests data from two primary sources:

1. **Sensor Buoys**: Environmental sensors deployed throughout Chesapeake Bay transmit readings every 30 seconds, providing measurements of:
   - Water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity)
   - Chemical contaminants (nitrogen compounds, phosphates, hydrocarbons)
   - Physical properties (temperature, salinity, conductivity)
   - Microplastics concentration

2. **Satellite Imagery**: Sentinel-2 satellites capture multispectral imagery every 15 minutes, offering:
   - Broad spatial coverage of the entire bay area
   - Spectral bands optimized for water quality assessment
   - Visual confirmation of potential pollution events

### Real-Time Processing

Data flows through a series of specialized Flink jobs that perform increasingly sophisticated analysis:

1. **Data Standardization**: Raw inputs undergo validation, normalization, and format standardization
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods identify unusual readings that may indicate pollution
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Clustering algorithms detect potential pollution hotspots
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Time-window processing differentiates new events from evolving existing ones
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Fluid dynamics models simulate contamination spread

### Medallion Architecture

The system implements a comprehensive medallion architecture for data management:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data preserved exactly as received, providing the foundation for reprocessing
- **Silver Layer**: Validated, cleansed, and standardized data ready for analysis
- **Gold Layer**: Derived insights, analytical results, and aggregated metrics for visualization

This approach ensures data quality while maintaining complete lineage from raw inputs to final insights.

### Event-Driven Communication

The components communicate through a message-driven architecture:

- **Kafka Topics**: Specialized topics for different data domains enable loose coupling
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed messages are captured for analysis and potential reprocessing
- **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management ensures consistent data formats

This design provides buffering during load spikes, enables multiple consumers for the same events, and ensures reliable message delivery.

## Flink Processing Jobs & ML Components

The system implements various machine learning models, each integrated into a specific Flink job to perform specialized analysis functions:

### Sensor Analyzer Job
- **Pollutant Classifier (RandomForestClassifier)**
  - **Input**: Sensor parameters [pH, turbidity, temperature, mercury, lead, petroleum, oxygen, microplastics]
  - **Output**: Pollution type classification [oil_spill, chemical_discharge, agricultural_runoff, sewage, algal_bloom, unknown]
- **Anomaly Detector (IsolationForest)**
  - **Input**: Same sensor parameters
  - **Output**: Detection of anomalies in sensor data (contamination=0.05)

### Image Standardizer Job
- **Image Classifier (RandomForestClassifier)**
  - **Input**: Features extracted from images [dark_patch_ratio, green_dominance, spectral_contrast, texture_variance, edge_density]
  - **Output**: Visible pollution type [oil_spill, algal_bloom, sediment, chemical_discharge, unknown]

### Pollution Detector Job
- **Confidence Estimator (RandomForestRegressor)**
  - **Input**: Detection metrics [num_points, avg_risk, max_risk, source_diversity, time_span]
  - **Output**: Confidence score (0-1) on detection validity

### ML Prediction Job
- **Oil Spill Model (RandomForestRegressor)**
  - **Input**: Environmental and pollution parameters [lat, lon, radius, pollution_level, wind_speed, wind_direction, current_speed, current_direction, hours_ahead]
  - **Output**: Spread prediction [new_lat, new_lon, new_radius]
- **Chemical Model (RandomForestRegressor)**
  - **Input**: Same environmental parameters
  - **Output**: Spread prediction specific to chemical pollutants

All models are basic implementations (RandomForest with only 10 estimators) trained on synthetic data, representing a limitation of the current implementation that would require enhancement for production deployment.

### Hybrid Processing Approach

The system effectively combines ML models with rule-based approaches:
- ML models enhance sensitivity for subtle pollution patterns
- Rule-based systems ensure reliable baseline detection
- Fallback mechanisms maintain system operation when ML encounters issues

This complementary approach has proven more effective than either method alone.

### Machine Learning Implementation

The system incorporates four specialized predictive models:

1. **Contamination Spread Model**: Uses fluid dynamics principles to predict how pollution will disperse through water based on currents, wind patterns, and pollutant properties

2. **Source Identification Algorithm**: Employs backtracking techniques to identify potential pollution sources based on detected patterns and environmental conditions

3. **Severity Classification System**: Categorizes pollution events by environmental impact severity using multi-parameter analysis and historical comparison

4. **Temporal Evolution Predictor**: Forecasts how contamination profiles will change over time, enabling proactive intervention planning

These models incorporate multiple environmental factors:
- Fluid dynamics principles for water movement modeling
- Pollutant physical properties (density, solubility, degradation rates)
- Environmental patterns (seasonal winds, water currents, temperature gradients)
- Historical pollution behavior patterns from similar events

### Containerization & Orchestration

The system leverages Docker and Docker Compose for consistent deployment and operation:

- **Service Isolation**: Each component runs in its own container with appropriate resource limits
- **Network Configuration**: Internal communication occurs over defined networks with appropriate security
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data is stored in named volumes for data preservation
- **Health Monitoring**: All services include health checks for operational monitoring
- **Resource Allocation**: Containers are configured with appropriate CPU and memory limits
- **Restart Policies**: Automatic recovery from failures ensures operational continuity

This containerized approach enables consistent deployment across development, testing, and production environments while simplifying scaling and maintenance.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

Despite its advanced capabilities, the current implementation has several limitations:

1. **Synthetic Data Reliance**: The system currently uses synthetic data rather than real NOAA/USGS APIs and Sentinel Hub services, limiting validation under authentic environmental conditions

2. **Static ML Models**: Basic RandomForest classifiers built on synthetic data without mechanisms for retraining with newly collected information. This means the system's predictive capabilities remain static, preventing improvement over time despite new data collection.

3. **Spatial Clustering Constraints**: The hybrid approach with fixed grid size struggles with events crossing grid boundaries and isn't optimal across varying data densities

4. **Data Governance Limitations**: The MinIO implementation lacks comprehensive governance features such as quality monitoring, lineage tracking, and automated schema evolution

5. **Limited Analytics**: Dashboard offers basic analytical capabilities compared to enterprise platforms

6. **External Integration**: Lacks integration with external alerting infrastructure necessary for operational deployment in environmental agencies

### Scaling Challenges

As the system scales to handle larger geographic areas or higher data volumes, several components would require enhancement:

- **Memory Management**: Flink jobs would encounter memory constraints during satellite imagery analysis and pollution detection. Without proper partitioning and memory management strategies, jobs would encounter OutOfMemoryError exceptions when handling larger or more frequent satellite images.

- **Spatial Clustering**: The current approach would face computational bottlenecks in high-density regions, where the SpatialClusteringProcessor must process numerous points within each partition

- **Message Broker**: The single-node Kafka configuration would experience performance degradation with increased volume

- **Time-Series Storage**: TimescaleDB would face challenges as data accumulates without proper hypertable partitioning strategies

### Potential Improvements

Several improvements could address current limitations without a complete redesign:

- **Continuous Learning**: Implement mechanisms for ML models to update with newly collected data through incremental learning that periodically retrains models as validated data becomes available

- **Adaptive Spatial Clustering**: Implement adaptive grid sizing based on data density with boundary-crossing detection mechanisms

- **State Management**: Develop improved strategies for Flink jobs including backpressure handling and optimized checkpointing

- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Implement automated archiving for historical data while maintaining access to recent measurements

- **Enhanced Analytics**: Strengthen the dashboard with more advanced analytical capabilities

### Future Work

With additional resources, future development would prioritize:

- **Real Data Integration**: Connect with NOAA, USGS, and Copernicus APIs for authentic environmental readings

- **Comprehensive ML Pipeline**: Develop continuous training, performance monitoring, and drift detection capabilities

- **Advanced Spatial Framework**: Implement multi-level gridding, adaptive partitioning, and specialized algorithms for different pollution patterns

- **Cross-Validation Mechanisms**: Create validation between different data sources to increase confidence in event detection

- **Infrastructure Optimization**: Implement proper Kafka clustering, optimize TimescaleDB, and deploy comprehensive monitoring

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Develop dynamic scaling capabilities based on data volume and processing requirements

## Lessons Learned

### Main Challenges

During development, we encountered several significant challenges:

1. **Distributed Pipeline Architecture**: Integrating multiple components through Kafka required extensive configuration and troubleshooting. Establishing correct topic structures, managing serialization formats, and ensuring proper message routing between components demanded considerable effort.

2. **Medallion Architecture Implementation**: The most time-consuming aspect was implementing proper data flow through our medallion architecture and developing effective deduplication strategies. Distinguishing between new pollution events and evolutions of existing ones proved exceptionally difficult.

3. **Spatial Clustering**: Creating deterministic hotspot IDs that accounted for spatial proximity and temporal evolution required multiple iterations to refine our clustering algorithms and spatial indexing strategies.

4. **Database Configuration**: Designing and configuring specialized databases for different types of data presented unique challenges, particularly configuring TimescaleDB for time-series sensor data, PostgreSQL with spatial extensions for geospatial analysis, and Redis for fast dashboard access.

5. **Heterogeneous Data Sources**: Working with different data sources presented significant complexity, from structured sensor readings to large satellite imagery—each requiring different ingestion, validation, and preprocessing approaches.

### What Worked Well

Several aspects of our implementation proved particularly effective:

1. **Medallion Architecture**: The medallion architecture proved highly effective for data quality management, enabling clean separation between raw data and processed insights while providing clear data lineage tracking.

2. **Apache Flink**: Stream processing capabilities exceeded expectations, providing robust real-time analysis with minimal latency. The exactly-once processing semantics and flexible windowing operations were particularly valuable.

3. **Containerized Microservices**: Our approach allowed for independent scaling and isolated development of each component, significantly accelerating the development cycle despite the system's complexity.

4. **Hybrid ML+Rules Approach**: Combining rule-based detection with machine learning models provided reliable baseline detection while enhancing sensitivity for subtle pollution patterns. This complementary approach proved more effective than either method alone.

5. **Data Standardization**: Standardizing formats immediately after ingestion significantly reduced downstream complexity.

### Key Insights

Limited time and resources forced strategic compromises, but taught valuable lessons:

1. **Data Quality Over Quantity**: For environmental monitoring systems, data quality is more critical than quantity, fundamentally shifting our focus from maximizing data collection to optimizing data reliability.

2. **Early Standardization**: The importance of data standardization early in the pipeline cannot be overstated.

3. **Functional Prototype First**: Our approach focused on creating a functionally complete prototype rather than a fully-scaled big data system, choosing technologies that support big data principles but implementing them in simplified configurations.

4. **Strategic Compromises**: We omitted Airflow for ML model orchestration, implemented basic observability with structured logging rather than a full monitoring stack, and used synthetic data generation for buoy readings rather than complex integration with real APIs, allowing us to deliver a functional prototype while understanding which areas would require expansion in a production environment.
